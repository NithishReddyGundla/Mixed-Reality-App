# Mixed Reality Art Gallery" Power App
### In this project, I have created a platform (Power App) where individuals/ enterprises can view art frames in mixed reality, measure in mixed reality, and markup in mixed reality for inspection and also AI Image Generator using OpenAI's DALLE-2 into my App using my OpenAI API.

## Project Overview
### The Mixed Reality Art Gallery Power App is an innovative solution that combines art and technology to create an immersive experience for users. With the "View in MR" feature, users can view art frames in mixed reality, allowing them to visualize and appreciate art in a new and exciting way. The "Measure in MR" feature allows users to take measurements in mixed reality, which can be useful for architects, designers, and other professionals. The "Markup in MR" feature allows users to markup in mixed reality, enabling them to inspect art pieces and also for any kind of inspection (i.e product inspection) which provide feedback in a collaborative and interactive way.

## How to Use the App
### Launch the app and try all the features like:
### AI Image Generator where you enter the desired prompt and choose the number of images to generate and BOOM "AI generates images". 
### "View in MR" feature to view art frames in mixed reality.
### Use the "Measure in MR" feature to take measurements in mixed reality by selecting the tool and placing it in the desired location.
### Use the "Markup in MR" feature to markup in mixed reality by selecting the tool and drawing on the art frame.

## Technical Details
### The Mixed Reality Art Gallery Power App was built using Microsoft Power Apps. TheThe "View in MR" feature was created using Microsoft Power Apps and Mixed Reality, while the "Measure in MR" and "Markup in MR" features were created using Microsoft Power Automate and Mixed Reality.

### All the art images are manually generated with prompts using "MIDJOURNEY" and "STABLE DIFFUSION" and created a 3D object (.glb) art frame to view in 3D. Not to forget, AI Image Generator. We can generate images with just a prompt right inside the App without needing to go to other image genarator apps(like DALLE-2, MIDJOURNEY and STABLE DIFFUSION). This is done using OpenAI's image generator API.

## Real-World use case (what problem this App solves in real-time!)
### The Mixed Reality Art Gallery Power App solves a real-world problem by providing a new and innovative way for art enthusiasts, architects, designers, and other professionals to view, measure, and markup art frames. Traditionally, viewing and measuring art frames require physical presence, and it can be challenging to view and measure them accurately.

###However, with this app, users can view art frames in mixed reality, allowing them to appreciate and analyze them from different angles and perspectives. The app's "Measure in MR" feature enables users to take measurements in mixed reality, which can be useful for architects, designers, and other professionals who need to measure the size and dimensions of the art frames accurately. The "Markup in MR" feature also enables users to markup art frames in mixed reality, allowing them to inspect art pieces and provide feedback in a collaborative and interactive way.

###By providing a new and innovative way to view, measure, and markup art frames, the Mixed Reality Art Gallery Power App solves a real-world problem and creates new opportunities for art enthusiasts, professionals, and businesses. It enables them to appreciate and analyze art pieces in a more interactive and immersive way, which can lead to new insights, ideas, and discoveries.


## Future Enhancements
### In the future, I plan to add additional features to the Mixed Reality Art Gallery Power App, including the ability to search for art frames, filter by artist or style, and purchase art directly from the app. We also plan to add support for additional devices and platforms, including iOS devices and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. And also, using neural radiance fields(NeRF),a software that uses AI and neural radiance fields (NeRF) to approximate how light behaves in the real world, enabling users to reconstruct a 3D scene or 3D objects from a handful of images taken at different angles.

# Conclusion
### The Mixed Reality Art Gallery Power App is an innovative solution that combines art and technology to create an immersive experience for users. With features such as "View in MR," "Measure in MR," and "Markup in MR," this app is an excellent tool for art enthusiasts, architects, designers, and other professionals. We hope you enjoy using this app as much as I enjoyed creating it!
